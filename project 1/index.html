<p id="one">Naruto (ナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto
  Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks to gain recognition from his peers and also dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader
   of his village. The story is in two parts, the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The
    series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in
     Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form
in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220
 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English adaptation of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to
  2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes.
   The English adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over
    to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode.</p>

  <p id="two">A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the
     Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha, the Fourth Hokage, seals the
      fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast;[e] this costs
      Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become leader of Konoha again.
       Naruto is often ridiculed by the Konoha villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails.
       Because of a decree made by the Third Hokage forbidding anyone to mention these events, Naruto knows
        nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto.
         Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher Iruka Umino.</p>

         <p id="three"> Konohamaru decides he and Boruto should go looking for Asaki themselves. They see Kankitsu leaving Remon's
            home, and Konohamaru decides to tail him, instructing Boruto to find Asaki. Konohamaru follows Kankitsu to
             a site, where he's spotted by Kankitsu's subordinates. Kankitsu informs him only people from the Daidai
             village are allowed on the site, and that he'll file a complaint about him with Konohagakure. His
             subordinates escort him out. Boruto spots Kankitsu when he returns, but also Asaki, and goes to
             talk to her. She doesn't recognise him, but spots Kankitsu with Remon's hair clip in the distance,
              and advises Boruto to leave. Asaki follows Kankitsu to the sealing rock, and Boruto follows her.
               She stops Kankitsu from destroying the hair clip, which ends up with Boruto. Asaki accuses Kankitsu
                of not being himself. Kankitsu surmises he has to do more than erase her memories, and moves in
                to finish her. Boruto forces his retreat with thrown kunai. He refuses to explain his intentions,
                 adding Boruto would only forget them anyway, and produces several will-o'-the-wisps that follow
                  Boruto around. Boruto dodges several of them, and Asaki blocks one with her own body. She grows
                   antlers, which send two wisps back to Kankitsu, and passes out </p>
