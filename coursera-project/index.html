Clap, clap come on

Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy) (Hey)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na, ah
All of my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
When he came in the room
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
That summer night in June</p>

I'm not impressed
With any mother fucking word I say
See I lied that I cried
When he came inside
And now I'm burning a highway Hades
Shut the fuck up
When I'm trying to think
I gotta keep my concentration
Give me one more drink
And then I'll try to remember all the advice
That my good book told me</p>
